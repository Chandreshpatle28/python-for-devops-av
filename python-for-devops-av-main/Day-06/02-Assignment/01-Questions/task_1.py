## Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
#1. Create two variables `a` and `b` with numeric values.
#2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
#3. Print the results.

x = 10
y = 5

sum = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * y
quotient = x / y

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
